# AbleTools Shared Server Deployment Summary

## Files Created for Deployment

### 1. DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
Complete deployment guide covering:
- Node.js enabled shared hosting
- Static hosting with API backend
- cPanel shared hosting
- Subdomain deployment
- Database migration
- Environment configuration
- Performance optimization
- Security setup
- Troubleshooting

### 2. SHARED_HOSTING_CHECKLIST.md
Step-by-step checklist including:
- Pre-deployment requirements
- Application preparation
- Database setup
- Upload and configuration steps
- Post-deployment verification
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Maintenance schedule

### 3. scripts/deploy.sh
Automated deployment script that:
- Builds the frontend application
- Installs production dependencies
- Creates deployment package
- Sets up environment configuration
- Generates Apache .htaccess file
- Creates startup scripts
- Packages everything for upload

### 4. server/database-config.ts
Production database configuration supporting:
- PostgreSQL connections
- MySQL connections
- SSL support for production
- Connection pooling
- Error handling

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Deployment Package
```bash
# Make the deployment script executable
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh

# Run the deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

This creates:
- `dist/` folder with all production files
- `abletools-deployment.tar.gz` archive for upload
- Production-ready configuration files

### Step 2: Upload to Shared Server
1. Upload `abletools-deployment.tar.gz` to your shared hosting account
2. Extract files to your web directory (public_html or subdirectory)
3. Update the `.env` file with your database credentials

### Step 3: Configure Database
Create a database through your hosting control panel and update `.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret
```

### Step 4: Install and Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

## Important Notes

### Database Migration
The current application uses in-memory storage. For production deployment, you'll need to:
1. Set up a PostgreSQL or MySQL database
2. Update the storage configuration to use the production database
3. Run database migrations to create tables
4. Populate with initial data

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Database (Required)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string

# Application (Required)
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000

# Security (Required)
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-session-secret

# Email (Optional - for contact forms)
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email
SMTP_PASS=your-password
```
